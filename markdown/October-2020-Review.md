I've been in Boise all month! I'm enjoying my team here - I'll make sure to write about my time here after I return home to California. This month, I've been really motivated to write - I've published 5 blogposts! Hopefully the habit sticks.

At work, I'm devoting about half my time to recruiting. Running several interviews a day is pretty stressful for an introvert like me. If you are or know a software engineer looking for work, help me out by [checking out our job description here](https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us)!

## Fitness

- I'm dealing with what I suspect to be [Athletic pubalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_pubalgia) - a sports hernia. I've had to cut back on both running and core work, but most weight room exercises seem to be OK.
- I've been going to [Axiom Parkcenter](https://www.axiomfitness.com/parkcenter) while I'm in Boise - it's a pretty great gym (see [Estimating Gym COVID Risk](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/COVID-Gym-Risk/) for evidence that gyms aren't that risky right now)!

## Reading

This month, I started using [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/jeff346), which will hopefully help me retain information that I read a little better. It also has a great Roam integration!
