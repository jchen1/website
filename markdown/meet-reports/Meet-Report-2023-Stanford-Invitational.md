Last weekend, I opened my outdoor season in the 2023 Stanford Invitational. I have a lot of personal history with this meet and with the Stanford track—I competed there in high school, and trained on the Stanford track through most of COVID.

I was doubly lucky to be able to compete in this meet: I had a friend on the inside who was able to get me a spot in the meet despite not coming close to the entry standards.
I've also been dealing with a couple injuries over the past month, most recently a facet joint sprain in my lower back. In fact, my first full-speed workout was the day before the meet.

<!-- excerpt -->

## 100m: 11.02 (+1.8)

- I felt relatively good warming up for the 100—my back, though stiff, didn't hurt when I ran.
- My block start was pretty good, and I was close to the front of the race through about 30m.
- Unfortunately, at max velocity, I didn't have as much bounce as I'm used to. I think this was the back injury limiting my ability to rotate my hips.
  Without that, my stride length felt much shorter than usual, and I was left behind.
- I finished 7th in my heat and 34th overall.
- This is the slowest 100 I ran since my [outdoor opener last year](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Meet-Report-2022-Carnegie-Mellon-Invitational/), a 11.24 into a -2.9 headwind.

## 200m: 22.54 (+0.7)

- The 200 was a day after the 100, so I was a little sore. My back actually felt better than the day before.
- The race was similar to the 100: I had a pretty good block start, led through the top of the curve, and then got passed by the field.
- My speed endurance seems to have completely disappeared after a month of inconsistent training. The last 50m really hurt!
- I finished last in my heat and 31st overall.
- This is slower than every outdoor 200 I've run since 2019!

Overall, while I'm happy to have gotten a chance to compete, I'm disappointed with my performances.
I'm hopeful that the back injury is just a minor setback, and that I can get back to my old form soon.
