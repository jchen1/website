I competed in the 100 and 200 at the 2022 Lee Invitational in Cleveland on May 14. This report, three weeks delayed, is necessarily quite short as I barely remember the races themselves.

<!-- excerpt -->

## 100m: 10.87 (+0.0)

- A fairly disappointing effortâ€”I stood up too quickly and ran out of steam by the end of the race.
- I felt a couple people beside me, especially in the last 20 meters, and overstrode significantly. I was lucky to not pull a hamstring; I definitely felt the stretch.

## 200m: 21.75 (+1.2)

- My first 150 was great, but I fell apart in the last 50.

Overall, this wasn't the best pair of performances. That said, both times are big improvements from [my efforts](/posts/Two-Meet-Reports/) last year at the same meet, where I ran 11.02 (-0.1) and 22.18 (+1.8).
