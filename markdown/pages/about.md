Hey, I'm Jeff! I'm a software engineer and amateur sprinter living in the Bay Area.

I studied **computer science** with a minor in human-computer interaction at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu/), and graduated in May 2016. I'm currently an engineering manager and also lead the infrastructure and security teams at [Ladder Life](https://ladderlife.com/). For more details about my work life, check out my [résumé](/resume/index.html).

I've been a runner for 15 years now, with a couple hiatuses in between. I competed for CMU; I was the captain of the track team and held the 60 meter school record. Since graduating, I've continued to train and compete. Here are my current personal bests:

- 60m: 6.73 (Freelap timed)
- 100m: 10.92 Freelap, 10.96 FAT
- 200m: 21.80 (Freelap timed)
- 400m: 49.50 (Freelap timed)

Note: Freelap times don't include reaction time; the FAT equivalent would likely be 0.15s slower.

I mostly write about engineering, sprinting, quantified self, and productivity. Interested in some of those things? **[Follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/iambald)**!
