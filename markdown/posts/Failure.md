Most of the posts on this blog are about success.
I write about my PRs, my wins, and my accomplishments.
I write about the things that I'm proud of.

When I write about my failures, I write about setbacks.
I write about how they are just temporary roadblocks that make my eventual success that much sweeter.

But sometimes failure is just failure.

Last weekend, I ran at the USATF Masters Championships as the twice-reigning champion.
I failed to defend those titles.

More importantly, I failed to compete at the level I know I'm capable of.
In the 100, despite having run [10.71 (+1.5)](/posts/Meet-Report-2023-Lee-University-Last-Chance/) in May, I could only muster 11.02 (+3.6).
In the 200, despite having run [21.82 (+1.1)](/posts/Meet-Report-2023-Mountain-Laurel-Invitational/) in April and [21.55 (-2.3)](/posts/Meet-Report-2022-Mountain-Laurel-Invitational/) last year, I only managed 21.99 (+0.9).

I failed to prepare for the stiffer competition I knew I'd face this year.
My diet and sleep in the weeks leading up to racing were poor. I wasn't locked in mentally.

After setting the fastest mark in the 100m prelims (10.90 -1.3), I failed to recover in time for the final round the next day.
That day, I failed to hydrate properly and barely finished the race.
I even failed to realize my failure: I didn't understand what had happened until I got back to my hotel room and drank about two gallons of water.

In the 200, I failed to execute my race strategy, going out harder than I should have on the curve.
Despite that failure, I held a slim lead with fifty meters to go. But I couldn't stay relaxed—I tightened up and failed to stave off my competition.
I lost at the line.

I don't write about failure because I don't think about failure.
My defense mechanisms kick in.

It's just one race.

It's just a learning experience.

I've dealt with injuries all year.

Second place isn't so bad.

There's always next year.

But I see this for what it is. I came to Greensboro to win and to set new personal bests.
I had the perfect opportunity to do both—and I crumbled in the moment.

I can't stop thinking about my failure.
My bitterness and regret are palpable. I'm _angry_ in a way that's new to me.

How will I respond to failure?
