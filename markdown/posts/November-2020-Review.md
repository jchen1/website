I'm back in the Bay Area and back into my usual routine! Here's what happened this month:

## Track & Fitness

![Acalanes High School{caption=Acalanes High School in the early morning}](/images/november-2020-review/hero.jpg)

Most of the tracks in the Bay are closed now. I've been running at Acalanes High, about 30 minutes away from my house. [Here's](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Bay-Area-Open-Tracks/) an updated list of open tracks in the Bay Area!
I've settled into my offseason training routine: Mondays and Fridays are speed days while Wednesdays are focused on acceleration. I have to be extra careful with my [warmups](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Warmups-For-Sprints/), since it's been cold in the mornings!
