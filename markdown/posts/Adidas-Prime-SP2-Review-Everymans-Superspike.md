This year, Adidas entered the superspike game with their Prime SP2. Their athletes found immediate success with the new spike, most notably 2022 world champions Noah Lyles and Shaunae Miller-Uibo. I recently managed to get my hands on a pair of SP2s and put them to the test.

## Fit and feel

I appreciate Adidas shipping a relatively normal colorway, especially compared to the recent awful [Maxfly](<![img](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/J4MAAOSwbd9isv7e/s-l500.jpg)>) [colorways](https://static.nike.com/a/images/t_PDP_1280_v1/f_auto,q_auto:eco/f669d845-033c-47a6-b917-89f984ba52d6/air-zoom-maxfly-track-field-sprinting-spikes-C2ZBRP.png).

The Prime SP2s run a half size large: I’m normally a 10.5 in trainers and spikes, but needed to size down to a 10 for these. The spike is comfortable—there’s a noticeable difference between these and Maxflies which make my feet hurt after just a few minutes in them.

Another difference between Adidas’ offering and Nike’s is durability: instead of an air bladder, the SP2s have a layer of stiff foam on top of a carbon plate for energy return. Without a bubble to pop, these spikes should last longer than a season, and are easier to recommend as both a competition and training spike.

Like other superspikes, the Prime SP2s are _bouncy_. The energy return is insane, especially at max speed, where it makes my swing phase noticeably faster. However, until I got used to the shoes, my feet were landing pretty far in front of my center of mass, increasing my ground contact time and risk of hamstring injury. This is a common issue with superspikes—I've heard talk of hamstring issues with Maxflies as well.

One area for improvement is in the heel—I needed to both tie a [heel lock](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/locklacing.htm) and run barefoot to keep my heels firmly in the shoe. Without both, my heels slip every time I start.

Overall, Adidas has made a comfortable and seemingly durable spike that I'm happy to run in.

## Are they faster?

I’ve run a couple of workouts, splitting reps between my two-year-old Superfly Elite 2s and the SP2. All of the below times were timed with a Freelap in very similar conditions. Of course, the sample size is quite small, so take these results with a grain of salt.

### 60m workout

| **Shoe**  | **Time** |
| --------- | -------- |
| Superfly  | 6.98     |
| Prime SP2 | 6.92     |
| Prime SP2 | 6.93     |
|           |          |

### 30m fly workout

| **Shoe**            | **Time** |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Superfly            | 3.08     |
| Superfly            | 3.11     |
| Superfly            | 3.02     |
| Superfly            | 3.03     |
| **Superfly (avg)**  | **3.06** |
| Prime SP2           | 2.95     |
| Prime SP2           | 3.03     |
| Prime SP2           | 2.97     |
| Prime SP2           | 2.99     |
| **Prime SP2 (avg)** | **2.99** |
|                     |          |

That's a pretty significant advantage for the Adidas spikes of ~2.2% in 30 meter flies. Distinguishing between other superspikes is harder: I found that the New Balance SD-X was ~1.5% faster than Superflys [last year](/posts/Super-Spikes-New-Balance-Fuelcell-Sigma-SD-X-Impressions/). I didn't explicitly test Maxflies in practice because of their durability concerns, but test times indicate a similar performance improvement over normal spikes.

## The best superspike?

I’ve tried three "superspikes" now: New Balance’s SD-X, Nike’s Maxfly, and now Adidas’ Prime SP2. All three improve performance by a similar margin over regular spikes. The Prime SP2, however, stands out as the most available and durable spike of the three. Given a choice, I'd recommend it over the others today—though with all three rarely in stock, whichever you can get your hands on will be a fine shoe.
