Another month in quarantine. It looks like there's light at the end of the tunnel, and earlier than I had [previously thought](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/2021-Predictions/)! Despite everything, the US has been by far the most effective country at getting shots in arms. Here's hoping that Fauci's right when he says that the general public will start getting vaccinated by the end of April! On to the review:

## Goal Tracking

- ðŸŸ¢ **Get 1% faster.** Training's been going pretty wellâ€”I've set a couple PRs in training! I'm running a 100m and 200m time trial next week which should tell me a lot about where I am. The only danger I see on the horizon is injuryâ€”I've got a mild case of high hamstring tendinopathy what I'll have to be careful to manage properly.
- ðŸŸ¢ **50% less discretionary spending.** Despite big spending for Valentine's Day (hotel, dinner, gift), I still managed to come in well under the bar I set for myself here. My February discretionary spending was **70%** lower than my average monthly spend in 2020 (but significantly higher than January).
- ðŸ”´**One hour of solitary free time a day.** Once again, I haven't managed to make time for this during the week. I haven't even been tracking this goal! In March, I'll make sure to keep track of whether or not I do this every day in Roam.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Twice-weekly live conversations with friends.** 4/4 again in February! It's been great to catch up with some people I haven't talked to since before the pandemic.

## Track & Fitness

- I managed a **660lb hex bar deadlift** this past week. That's a 60lb/10% PR since last September! I've tracking pretty close to my goal for this season of 700lbs. I might need to [buy some more weights first though](https://twitter.com/iambald/status/1364746261295812608)!
- I ran a **2.94s 30m fly in 41 degree weather**, which equals my second-fastest time ever and is by far the fastest I've run in sub-50-degree weather. Using the equation I derived in my [blogpost about temperature and speed](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Temperature-And-Speed/), 2.94s is 0.14s faster than expected for 41-degree weather! (For comparison, my PR of 2.93s, set in 64-degree weather, is just 0.10s faster than expected.)
- My hamstring tendinopathy isn't getting better. I'll have to manage it with more active recovery and less sprinting and deadlift volume.

- [The Art of War (Machiavelli)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55219604-the-prince-and-the-art-of-war)â€”I bailed on this one. Maybe in a different setting I'd be interested in a treatise about medieval warfare, but it just isn't for me.
