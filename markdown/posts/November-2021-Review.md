November was... busy. December will be too.

## Goal Tracking

- üü° **Get 1% faster.**
- üî¥ **50% less discretionary spending.** I spent about twice as much this month as my average in 2020‚Äîbetween holiday flights, a trip to New York, and Black Friday, I blew my spending record for the year out of the water.
- üü° **One hour of solitary free time a day.**
- üü° **Twice-weekly live conversations with friends.**

## Writing
