October was my first full month in Atlanta since Mayâ€”but I still found a way to get out of town for a couple of weekends. We have more travel upcoming in November and December, which is exciting but also maybe a bit too much.

## Goal Tracking

- ðŸŸ¡ **Get 1% faster.** I tweaked my hamstringâ€”time will tell how long I'm out, but it seems certain that my training will be affected for at least a couple weeks.
- ðŸ”´ **50% less discretionary spending.** October's discretionary spending was **19%** under 2020's average, buoyed by the couple travel weekends I hadâ€”a wedding in San Antonio, a weekend in Clayton, and upcoming travel to New York.
- ðŸŸ¡ **One hour of solitary free time a day.**
- ðŸŸ¡ **Twice-weekly live conversations with friends.**

## Track & Fitness

- I ran a couple Freelap-timed 150s in **16.82** and **16.85** (with 15 minutes in between). It's an exciting preseason performanceâ€”the only comparable I have is a hand-timed 16.7 in college the season before I ran a 7.06 60m on a bum hamstring.
- I strained my hamstring the week afterwards (yesterday). It seems pretty minor, but it's still really frustrating to hit a roadblock after stringing together a few good months.
- That's two hamstring injuries, to the same leg, within a few months. Something clearly has to changeâ€”with technique, training, or both.
