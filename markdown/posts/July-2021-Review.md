July was busy: we hosted my parents and some friends in Montana for the first two weeks, I traveled to Des Moines for the USATF Masters Championships, and I'm writing this on the way to Chicago for a bachelor party. With Delta on the rise and lockdowns restarting, this might have been my last chance to see friends in person for a whileâ€”I'm glad that I got my travel in now.

## Goal Tracking

- ðŸŸ¢ **Get 1% faster.** I ran a personal best of [10.79](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Meet-Report-2021-USATF-Masters-Championships/) in the 100m, achieving my goal of being 1% faster on the year!
- ðŸ”´ **50% less discretionary spending.** I spent 12% more on discretionary things than my 2020 average. A big chunk of that is two flights and hotel stays in Des Moines and Chicago, but then again, my 2020 average includes travel too. 
- ðŸŸ¡ **One hour of solitary free time a day.** My work-life balance continues to be fairly good, and I've been spending more of my free time enjoying the outdoors and reading.
- ðŸŸ¢ **Twice-weekly live conversations with friends.** This was mostly facilitated by friends and family visiting us in Montana, and myself traveling to Iowa and Illinois. I suspect next month will be somewhat harder.

## Track & Fitness

- My track season's over after a PR of 10.79 in the 100m. I'm taking about a month off of the track to recuperate.
- I strained my hamstring in that 100m effort, so I'm currently religiously rehabbing it so that it doesn't scar.
- Without track work, I'm focusing more on the weight room.
