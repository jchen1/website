- This month, I've been really focused on work - we have a big launch coming very soon, so I've spent more hours than normal coordinating & building things for that.
- To close my track "season", I was able to run time trials in the 100/200/400 with lifetime PRs in all of them!

<!-- excerpt -->

# Track

- I set PRs in the standing long jump and 100m, equaled my PR in the 200m
  - Standing long jump: 3.16 meters - previous best of 3.12 set in Fall 2015
  - 100m: freelap-timed 10.92 - previous best of FAT 10.96 set October 2019
    - [video link](https://www.athletic.net/post/YViKEM0HBiWknkqtR)
  - 200m: freelap-timed 22.10 - tied my FAT record
    - [video link](https://www.athletic.net/post/wOiD80qsdFlQdQLTy)
  - 400m: camera-timed 49.5 - previous open time was 51.27 in April 2016
- Also had a few cool workouts:

  - set a flying 30m #freelap PR of 3.00 on [[August 3rd, 2020]], equaled it on [[August 14th, 2020]] and [[August 26th, 2020]]
  - 200@95%, 2m rest, 200@95%, 8m rest, 150@100%

    - 22.4
    - 23.9
    - 17.1

  - 325/120, 15m rest, 200/120
    - 325/120 38.6 16.1
    - 200/120 24.8 15.8

- #[[weight room]]
  - Now that I'm re-acclimated to the weight room, I'm feeling pretty close to the end of linear gains. Since my weight room training is secondary to track workouts, I set up a super basic #[[weight room]] [linear periodization](https://barbend.com/3-most-common-types-periodization-when-to-use-them/) with 4 week mesocycles. Hopefully this will let me continue to progress weight-wise while not burning out.
  - Two months of nordic hamstring curls have started to pay off: my hamstrings are noticeably stronger eccentrically!

# Projects

- #metrics
  - Upgraded deno version to 1.3 - this was surprisingly non-trivial because of breaking API changes from 1.0
- Not much to speak of this month - Dragon Age has been eating up my already limited free time
