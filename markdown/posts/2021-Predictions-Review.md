Now that it's 2022, I've scored my [2021 predictions](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/2021-Predictions). To get slightly bigger samples, I inverted the prediction and predicted probability of <50% predictionsâ€”e.g. "Democrats win both Georgia seats: 25%" became "Democrats do not win both Georgia seats: 75%" for scoring purposes.

<!-- excerpt -->

| Predicted Probability | Actual Probability |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 90+%                  | 89%                |
| 80-89%                | 75%                |
| 70-79%                | 63%                |
| 60-69%                | 58%                |
| 50-59%                | 67%                |

I was a little overconfident across the board, but this actually lined up a lot better than I thought it would:
