I've competed in track events since 2006, and I thought it'd be fun to look back and see how I've progressed since then. All times are FAT unless otherwise noted.

### Some observations

- Progress isn't always linear: I've dealt with serious injuries and setbacks throughout my high school and college career. Despite that history, I'm faster now than I've ever been before.
- I've taken two prolonged breaks from the sport (2013-14 and 2017-19). Both times, I was able to return and set PRs within a year.
- It was surprisingly hard to find records of old PA USATF meets—I have memories of running faster than what's listed for 2006-2008, but I couldn't find any documentation. Similarly, online high school statistics didn't match my memory—fortunately, my head coach was a stats nerd and kept meticulous records of every meet I ever raced in (and emailed them out every week!) College statistics, on the other hand, are reliably tracked on TFRRS.
