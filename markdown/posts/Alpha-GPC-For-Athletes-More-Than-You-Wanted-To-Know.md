Intro: what it is, what it purports to do

<!-- excerpt -->

## Mechanism of action

how it claims to work: choline becomes acetylcholine which tells muscles to fire; in theory if your CNS' limiting factor was acetylcholine you maybe would see power improvements

## The research

six total studies

| Study                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Date | Hypotheses tested | Significant findings | Notes                           |
