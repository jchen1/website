I moved to Montana this summer. Now, in the dead of winter, I'm paying the price. I thought I'd run in the cold before—I've [written](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Temperature-And-Speed/) about the relationship between temperature and speed. But Montana winters hit different—I'm often outside in single-digit weather with wind chill down into the negative teens. But a man's gotta work out, no matter the temperature, so I've done what I needed to do to work out and get fit. Here's what's worked for me so far:

<!-- excerpt -->

### Don't run outside if you can help it

Below a certain temperature, max-effort sprinting is a fool's errand. It's almost impossible to get warm and even harder to stay warm between reps. I'm fortunate to have access to an indoor track a half hour away—I'll use it on max effort days when it's under 20 degrees. On tempo days, I'll use the curved treadmill in my gym if it's under 10 degrees or if there's snow down and I don't have time to shovel.

### Get the right gear

I tend to follow backpacking and skiing advice for cold-weather sprinting: layer up! I have merino tights and a merino mid-layer which I almost always wear combined with thick synthetic tights and compression shirts. Over all that, I wear a thick hoodie and sweatpants, and bundle up with a neck gaiter, a beanie, gloves, and mittens. I'll often even warm up with a winter coat on—while it kills mobility, it's worth it during the warm up.

### Warm up

I make a point to break a sweat in warmups no matter the outside temperature—elevating your core temperature massively reduces your risk of injury. Staying warm is just as important. So far, moderately reducing rest periods and putting my sweats back on between reps has been enough for me, but I may experiment with leaving my car running and escaping to it between reps on, say, speed endurance sessions where I'm working with 10-20 minute rest times.

### Shovel the day before

Showing up to the track to a foot of snow is a great way to get a workout in before your real workout. I've found that it's best to shovel the day before if you can—shoveling out 150 or 200 meters can be backbreaking.

More generally, it's important to be mentally prepared for what's in store. I always have the hourly/daily/weekly weather report open on my laptop so that I can plan my workouts ahead of time—what time of day I'll go, if I'll have to shovel, and whether I'll run outside, inside, or even shift my workout days to hit the warmest times of the week.

### Set expectations appropriately

You'll be slower in the cold—your CNS won't fire as quickly, your muscles will be less reactive, you'll carry more weight from clothing, the track and your spikes will be harder and less responsive, and more. I've noticed time differences of 0.3 to 0.5 seconds between indoor (60F) and outdoor (10-15F) 60 meter runs this year.

Sprinters gravitate towards warmer climates for good reason—it's harder to get on the track and sprint when it's consistently below freezing. But harder's not impossible. If you're well-prepared with the right equipment and warm up well, cold is just another obstacle to overcome.
