My last meet of the indoor season was the Big Sky Preview, once more in Bozeman. As usual, I signed up for the 60 and 200.

MSU has been a fantastic host—I'm grateful to the team for allowing me to compete with them, and just as grateful to all of the event staff.

<!-- excerpt -->

## 60m: 6.98

- I had an excellent drive phase and had a step on everybody.
- Unfortunately, as I came up, I stumbled, knocked my feet together, and lost a ton of momentum.
- While I was able to stay in the race, I didn't really have a shot at a good time.
- The last 30 meters showed my top speed is improving—I was making up ground on the competitors in front of me.
- 6.98 is the worst time I've run over the past two years... but still is faster than any 60 I ran before then. To have that bad of a stumble and still come out under 7 seconds is encouraging.
- All that said, this races feels like a missed opportunity. The winner of the meet ran 6.88, and I was clearly in the lead at 10 meters—what could I have done today?

## 200m: 22.25

- My stumble in the 60 had my right hamstring feeling sore. I was questioning whether to even run the 200, but in the end decided that it felt good enough to attempt it.
- The race went fairly similarly to every indoor 200 I've run in Bozeman this year: I got out fairly strong and passed the guy to my outside on the second curve, despite some fairly bad sprint mechanics at the start of that curve.
- 22.25 ties my second best performance on this track and is just 0.04 off my PR here. It was also enough to give me the win.

I've had a really good indoor season, so I'm not too disappointed about this meet. I'm excited to have a few weeks off before outdoors—my schedule isn't finalized yet, but I'm likely going to take about six weeks before jumping back into competition towards the end of March.
