Sleep is a competitive advantage: good sleep is associated with [improved short and long-term memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768102/), [muscle synthesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8627466), and [muscle recovery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4689288/), while sleep deprivation [impairs cognitive performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/) and [increases injury risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028798/). Said differently: how much money and time would you spend on a panacea that significantly improves both mental and athletic performance?

Because sleep is so important, I've assembled a stack of habits and tools for measuring and improving my sleep quality:

<!-- excerpt -->

## Habits

- **No caffeine after noon.** Caffeine’s half life is [5 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/) long. The average espresso shot has [63mg](https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-there-more-caffeine-in-espresso-than-in-coffee/) of caffeine, while doses [as low as 9mg are psychoactive](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00487227). That means it takes your body more than 10 hours to clear a single shot from your system! Given that I tend to sleep around 9-10 every night, I stop all caffiene intake after noon.
- **Consistent bed and wake time.** [Sleep regularity is associated with stonger academic performance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4). I make sure to sleep and wake within a 30 minute window every weeknight. Although I try to keep my bedtimes consistent on the weekends as well, I'm admittedly much worse at that.
- **Nine-hour sleep opportunity.** I'm in bed for at least nine hours a night. Focusing on sleep opportunity instead of time slept helps me break insomniac's anxiety—I can't sleep because I'm worried about not being able to sleep.
- **No NSAIDs or antihistamines at night.** NSAIDs [disrupt sleep](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031938494903883). Antihistamines [interfere with deep sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252975/). Simple enough to avoid both of these before bed.
- **No devices in bed.** Devices in bed can [affect your circadian cycle](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-electronics-affect-sleep) and are generally stimulating instead of relaxing. I'm had trouble sticking to this habit, but my sleep quality is demostrably better when I do manage to put away my phone before bed.

## Tools

- **[WHOOP](https://join.whoop.com/#/439C34)**. My WHOOP strap measures time spent asleep, resting heart rate, and heart rate recovery, and synthesizes that into a Recovery score from 1-100%. Impressively, my Recovery score generally matches how I feel. More impressively, when they don't match up, my workout performance is better predicted by Recovery than qualitative feel.
- **[Awair Glow (discontinued)](https://www.amazon.com/Awair-Glow-Quality-Monitor-Smart/dp/B06ZXY8ZQZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)**. The Awair Glow measures ambient temperature, CO2, relative humidity, and VOC concentration, and synthesizes that into an air score from 1-100. The most important metrics out of those are CO2 and ambient temperature: high nighttime CO2 concentrations [decrease sleep quality, ability to concentrate, and cognitive performance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26452168/), and ambient temperature is an important personal preference to keep consistent.
- **[Eight Sleep Pod Pro](https://www.eightsleep.com/)**. The Pod Pro regulates my bed temperature. It's adjustable—I keep my bed cooler than ambient while I fall asleep, and have it warm up throughout the night. The Pod Pro also does sleep tracking: it measures time spent asleep, time to fall asleep, sleep and wake times, tosses and turns, ambient temperature, resting heart rate, and HRv, and synthesizes that into a sleep fitness score from 1-100% (sound familiar?). I've had my Pod Pro for a couple of weeks now—I was skeptical at first, but it's had a really noticeable effect on my sleep quality and WHOOP Recovery!
- **[ZMA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZMA_(supplement)>)**. The link between ZMA and sleep quality is weak to non-existent. Supplementing ZMA does give me really vivid dreams, however, which I enjoy.
- **Sleep mask & blackout curtains**. These help me fall and stay asleep, especially during the summer when I go to sleep when it’s still light out. Using a sleep mask also helps me avoid devices when I should be trying to sleep.
