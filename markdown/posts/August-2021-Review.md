My time in Montana is coming to an endâ€”I'll be spending the next few days camping in Glacier National Park, then heading back down to Atlanta. This past summer really was something specialâ€”Livingston and the whole state just have great vibes.

## Goal Tracking

- ðŸŸ¢ **Get 1% faster.** Not much to say hereâ€”I hit this goal and it's the offseason! Since preseason is coming up again, I'll probably change this goal next month.
- ðŸ”´ **50% less discretionary spending.** I spent just 1.8% less this month than my 2020 average. In retrospect, expecting to hit this goal while in Montana was probably foolishâ€”I've been way more lax about eating out and paying for experiences than normal.
- ðŸ”´ **One hour of solitary free time a day.** Still not tracking thisâ€”clearly I'm not prioritizing this goal. A good lesson for next time.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Twice-weekly live conversations with friends.** Managed this all but one week this month.

## Track & Fitness

- I'm fully recovered from my hamstring tear! I even managed to get back on the track for some acceleration work.
- I feel really bouncyâ€”I don't have any numbers, but I'm almost hitting my head against the ten-foot gym ceiling on double-leg veritcal jumps!
- August was a light month for me; I'll be starting preseason training next month when I'm back in Atlanta.

## Projects

- I built a MacOS version of [JOTA](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jota-easy-2fa/id1478072187), with automatic syncing with the iOS version. I'm hoping to release it to the App Store next month, but in the meantime, you can build it from [source](https://github.com/jchen1/jota).
