We're buying a house! I thought it'd be interesting to document our process—as first-time homebuyers, we've had to learn a lot very quickly. I'm sure we've made plenty of mistakes—hopefully nothing that'll be too painful when we realize them.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Hunting

- choosing a location
- looking online (resources, stat gotchas, etc)
  - in particular sq footage is a lie
- mortgage pre-qual
  - we used Better for this because they only required a soft credit pull
  - Better authorized a loan of 1.9MM for a 2.375MM home.... which is extremely aggressive
- moves very slowly....... then very quickly

## Offering

- tenancy types
  - joint tenancy with right of survivorship: implicit 50/50 split. parties must agree to sell. if one dies the share goes to the other party, bypassing wills/probate etc.
  - Tenancy in common: you can specify split of ownership & either party can force a sale at any time. if one party dies their share goes to their estate
- working with a realtor
  - exclusivity
  - unexpectedly very SMS-based
- don't fall in love (but we did...)
- contingencies
  - Inspection contingency
  - financing
  - appraisal
  - title 
  - Insurance
- backup offer
  - something like 20-25% of offers fall through for whatever reason
    - sale contingency, inspection contingency, etc
  - we had to be absolutely ready to go if the first offer fell through
  - heard about the offer falling through friday, flew out Sunday to see the property (and it would have been earlier if not for the track meet i had on saturday)
  - 
- generally speaking contracting is much messier than what i've seen in the workplace:
  - docs flying around, not cancelling things that change
  - lots of verbal "this will be fine" without documentation to back it up
    - in the end this appears to have actually been fine, but i really wonder how much of this would have stood up in court
- 

## Mortgage

- rates
  - cost to reduce rate varied significantly
  - even within the same lender, going from say 5.5 to 5.25 vs 5.25 to 5 could be anywhere from 800-4.5k(!)
  - when buying points we mostly considered the time to break-even
    - our hypothesis is that interest rates are likely to continue to rise for the next couple years (i.e. the Fed won't reduce rates significantly in response to recession), and therefore we aren't likely to refi for ~3-4 years minimum
    - we ended up buying quite a few points
- shopping around
  - lenders are very hesitant to give official loan estimates
  - rate lock is basically committing to that lender—you *can* switch or get multiple rate locks but it's not good form, esp. when working with local people
  - rate locks can be for 15/30/45/60 days depending on the lender's expected time to close. shorter rate lock means lower rates typically (the one example i had was a 12.5 bps decrease when going from a 30->15 day rate lock)
  - we were (are?) not in a hurry to close; surprisingly a lot of lenders emphasized their ability to close quickly
  - to compare, we made a chart showing rate, APR, closing costs excluding pre-paid & reserves, 5 year cost
- getting a pre-approval letter was much easier than anticipated—didn't need any docs
  - we were worried about this because the deadline was 3 days post-offer
  - we did, however, need a hard credit pull
- local vs national
  - national lenders (better, ally, sofi, etc) offered much better rates
  - we were locked into a local/regional bank
  - local lenders claimed that the discount national ones:
    - would not survive a recession at those rates
    - used those low rates more for marketing than reality—they were applicable to only a very small subset of consumers
    - would take much longer to close, putting the home at risk
- assets
  - we have a couple big accounts and a ton of small-ish accounts (various IRAs, 401k, etc)
  - lenders only care about having enough assets (loan-to-asset ratio?) to cover the down payment & have a buffer in case of issues with jobs
  - made our life a lot easier to only have to submit 5 total accounts instead of ~20!
  - lenders want two months of statements for each asset you submit, so fewer accounts is definitely better
- credit
  - hard pull from all three bureaus, take the median score (tri-merge(?))
  - our actual credit scores were somewhat lower than what credit karma/our banks reported
    - lender claimed that credit card "scores" are not based on any of the three credit bureaus at all 
- negotiating (...)
  - we talked to a few lenders & got rates
  - asked them to give a concession... and they did!
  - we ended up going with the lender our realtor recommended—their rate was the lowest of the local banks anyways, and we didn't want to rock any boats since both our realtor & LO seem to be pretty prominent in the community
- home insurance
  - turns out the local people are just geico!
    - actually this is wrong; turns out geico somehow got our information...
  - strangely, you need to send home insurance information directly to the lender

## Diligence

- home inspection
  - we pulled out all the stops here—extremely big investment. in particular: radon which is a big thing here
- docs about appliance warranties etc
- visiting
- home warranty
- they're required to produce a doc with all known issues
