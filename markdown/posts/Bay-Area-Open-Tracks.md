It's getting harder to find tracks to run on in the Bay Area. Here's a list of what's open (and what's not):

<!-- excerpt -->

## Open

- **[Kezar Stadium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kezar+Stadium/@37.7669182,-122.4561008,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xbf7eb40373b05a10?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj994rqo4DtAhXUjp4KHbDjDk0Q_BIwIHoECCsQBQ)** - San Francisco
  - Kezar is a beautiful track - but often pretty crowded with unaware joggers and PTs. I've had a few near misses here!
- **[Cubberly Community Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cubberley+Community+Center/@37.4171727,-122.108414,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xb69ce05121f7400d?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7oov6o4DtAhUCrJ4KHUanBIQQ_BIwCnoECBUQBQ)** - Palo Alto
  - This track has lanes but no distance markings, which makes precise workouts hard.
- **[Acalanes High School](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Acalanes+High+School/@37.8736881,-122.2030123,12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sacalanes+high+school!3m4!1s0x808562323022a44b:0xe18739f25e4608b3!8m2!3d37.9043022!4d-122.0977377)** - Lafayette
  - Open on weekends and on weekdays until 7:30AM and after 3:30PM

## Maybe Open

These are tracks that I've heard may be open, but haven't checked myself.

- Someone at Acalanes told me that all of the high schools in the school district are open: **Campolindo High**, **Las Lomas**, and **Miramonte High**
- **[Ruth Asawa School of the Arts](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ruth+Asawa+San+Francisco+School+of+The+Arts/@37.7453141,-122.4485649,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xa53cbc532c06f5c2?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjqlMbisIDtAhXNjp4KHSj6B0MQ_BIwCnoECBIQBQ)** - San Francisco

## Closed

- All Pleasanton USD schools: **Amador Valley** and **Foothill High**
- All San Ramon Valley USD schools: **Cal High**, **San Ramon Valley High**, **Dougherty Valley**, **Monte Vista**
- **Stanford University**

If you know of other tracks that are open or closed in the Bay, please [let me know](mailto:hello@jeff.yt) and I'll add them to the list!
