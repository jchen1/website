I'm going to Idaho for the month of October! The Bay Area feels disconnected in its COVID response from the rest of the country - I'm excited to find out if that's true.

This month, I set some huge gym PRs & ran my last time trial of the track season. With the offseason upon me, I'm ready to start a strength & explosiveness block in the weight room.

<!-- excerpt -->

# Track

Last time trial of the season - a huge 200m Freelap PR of 21.80!
