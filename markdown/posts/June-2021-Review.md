Just as I've settled into a pretty good groove in Atlanta, I spent the past few days driving across the country again, this time to [Livingston, Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_Montana) where I'll be spending the next two months! It's the best time of year to be in Montana, and we absolutely loved it when we visited neighboring Wyoming last fall.

## Goal Tracking

- üü° **Get 1% faster.** I raced once in June‚Äîa 100 in [a rainy 11.05](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Meet-Report-2nd-Annual-Sunset-Summer-Classic/). I only have one more chance this season to set a big PR, at the [USATF Masters Outdoor Championships](https://www.usatf.org/events/2021/2021-usatf-masters-outdoor-championships) in a few weeks. I have my taper planned out‚ÄîI'm confident that weather permitting, I'll have some great races.
- üî¥ **50% less discretionary spending.** I spent 22% less on discretionary things than my 2020 average. It's been death by a thousand cuts‚ÄîI've just been spending more on little things. Hopefully I do better in July.
- üî¥ **One hour of solitary free time a day.** Despite my work-life balance being better than it's been in a while, I haven't been spending my extra time very wisely. Mostly it's been mindless browsing.
- üü¢ **Twice-weekly live conversations with friends.** Back into the green!

## Track & Fitness

- I have just about two weeks until my 10-day taper starts‚ÄîI'm going to spend them building up a little more power, strength, and speed endurance.
- I've introduced a couple variations into my program:
  - [Ins-and-outs](https://simplifaster.com/articles/ins-outs-sprint-tempo-training/) help me build speed endurance and help me feel what the second 50m of the 200 should feel like.
  - Heavy hang and power cleans in the weight room for more powerful block starts
