I flew into Des Moines with just one more chance to achieve my season goal: to be [1% faster](https://jeffchen.dev/posts/2021-Goals/) than last year. I arrived two days before the meet on Thursday—I'd planned for preliminaries on Friday, but my age group (25-29) didn't have enough competitors to need them.

<!-- excerpt -->

More than any other meet I've raced in recent memory, this meet felt **legit**. The organizers flawlessly handled more than two thousand entrants across more than a thousand different age-group-event pairings—anyone who's ever been to a track meet before can attest to that level of difficulty. Huge props to USATF and Iowa State for putting together such a well-run meet on short notice!

I was surprised by how many people I recognized at the meet—compatriots I'd shared a track with in both California and Atlanta. But I was more surprised by a couple people recognizing me from this blog! (Hey there, Allesandro and Chris!) The track community is one of the biggest reasons I love and stay with the sport—I had a great time meeting both fellow post-collegiate athletes and "true" masters competitors.

Since this was my last meet of the season, I ran a 10-day taper—my last day in the weight room was a week before the race, and I gradually dropped my track volume to about 40-50% of normal. Despite sleeping in a hotel room for consecutive nights, I felt remarkably fresh and loose on Saturday morning.

I had been struggling with my first step in practices, but I was explosive out of the blocks and took a lead from the very start. I stayed patient through my drive and transition phases, and hit max speed feeling great. Unfortunately, somewhere between 60 and 70 meters, just a few steps into my max velocity phase, I felt a twinge in my left hamstring.

I immediately stopped pushing—thankfully, I was still able to cycle at 80-90% and slowly decelerate without making it worse. I managed to win the race, and was shocked to find that despite the injury I had still set a PR! Of course, it was wind-aided—correcting down to a legal +2.0 with [this calculator](https://maximmoinat.github.io/windCalculator.html) still nets a big PR of 10.81. And I really wonder what could have been—it's impossible to say for sure, but I think dropping into the 10.6 range was a real possibility. My evidence is weak but existent: in Usain Bolt's famous 9.69s world record in Beijing, where he showboated before the finish line, his last 10 meter split was 0.07s slower than his 80-90m split—if he had maintained his speed, his record might have actually been closer to 9.63. Extrapolating to my situation, I started slowing down much earlier than Bolt, so perhaps I lost more time than him.

Speculation aside, if I had one complaint about the meet organization, it would be that there was nowhere to warm up with a track surface. Instead, athletes warmed up on grass. For the most part, I don't mind it—but my last warmup stride is typically close to maximal effort with spikes on, which isn't quite the same on grass. Of course, this is a minor quibble—I certainly don't think it explains either my result or injury.

## 200m: scratch

With only one functional hamstring, I scratched the 200.

## Conclusion

I have mixed, but mostly positive, feelings about this meet. On the negative side, I came away injured, wasn't able to compete in the 200, and missed out on a potentially huge PR. But on a positive note, despite getting hurt, I still set a PR and achieved my goal for the season. I met some great competitors and athletes, and had a ton of fun here in Iowa. I'm already looking forward to next season!
